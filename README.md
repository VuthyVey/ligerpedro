## 📝 Description
Pedro is a digital currency used at the Liger Leadership Academy, a high school in Cambodia. The web app was developed by the students themselves. The name <b>Pedro</b> was inspired by the Napoleon Dynamite movie.

⚠️ **Note:** This project is no longer maintained and may not work with current versions of Node.js and Express.js.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this project was to teach high school students about financial literacy, to help manage our expenses on necessities and food. Instead of using Riels or Dollars, we used Pedro. It served as a medium for everyday transactions, such as paying for groceries, toiletries, and other essentials.
